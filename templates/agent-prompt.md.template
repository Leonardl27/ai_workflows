# Agent Prompt Template

Use this structure to write clear, effective prompts for AI coding agents.

---

## Task

[One sentence describing what you want done.]

Example: "Refactor the `process_order` function to separate validation from business logic."

## Context

[Background the agent needs to make good decisions. Include: what the code does, why the change is needed, and any relevant history.]

Example: "This function handles order processing in our e-commerce API. It currently mixes input validation, price calculation, and database writes. We need to add discount rules next sprint, and the current structure makes that difficult."

## Scope

[Specific files, functions, or areas to focus on. Explicitly list what's in and out of scope.]

Example:
- In scope: `src/orders/process.py`, `src/orders/validators.py`
- Out of scope: `src/orders/models.py` (schema changes are a separate task)

## Constraints

[What the agent must NOT do. Prevents common failure modes.]

Example:
- Do not change function signatures in `__init__.py` (other modules import from there)
- Do not add new dependencies
- Keep all functions under 30 lines

## Expected Output

[How you want the result delivered. Asking for a plan before code prevents large unwanted diffs.]

Example: "Show me your refactoring plan first — list which functions you'll create, move, or modify. Wait for my approval before writing code."

## Usage Tips

1. **Fill in every section.** Skipping "Constraints" is the most common source of unwanted AI output.
2. **Be concrete.** "Refactor for readability" is vague. "Split the 80-line function into 3 functions under 25 lines each" is actionable.
3. **Include file paths.** The agent can read them for context, reducing misunderstandings.
4. **Ask for a plan first** for any change touching more than one file.
